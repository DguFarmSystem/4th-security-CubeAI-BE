## **Info**

**Cube AI** is a web-based AI learning platform designed to let anyoneâ€”from elementary students to non-majorsâ€”easily build and experiment with deep learning models **without programming knowledge**.

- **Block-based model design:** visually configure models with drag-and-drop
- **Real-time learning visualization:** monitor model training and inference results live
- **Built-in AI Tutor:** get personalized explanations, guidance, and troubleshooting

This enables users to intuitively understand the structure and concepts of deep learning, verify the performance of their own models, and learn by doing.

---

## **Features**

- **Drag-and-drop model builder:** Combine CNN, RNN, MLP, and more through blocks
- **Data management:** Upload local datasets or use provided samples, with preprocessing tools built-in
- **Real-time training monitor:** Track loss, accuracy, and performance graphs
- **Inference & testing:** Run predictions with trained models directly
- **AI Tutor:** Offers conceptual explanations, error handling, and step-by-step guidance
- **Curriculum integration:** Structured theory + hands-on practice learning paths

---

## **User Flow**

1. Create or load a project
2. Upload and preprocess data
3. Design the model in the **drag-and-drop editor**
4. Run training and monitor progress in real-time
5. Evaluate and test model performance
6. Consult the **AI Tutor** for guidance or troubleshooting
